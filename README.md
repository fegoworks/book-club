### Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>
- Given the time constraint, I am yet to fully implement some of the features listed below:
   - The responsive search bar, only meant to be available on mobile screens
   - The sidebar on mobile screen is not as responsive yet, I hope to have that working soonest. For now, the hamburger menu when clicked simply pulls the sidebar out, the transition effect is missing at the time of writing this and I am also yet to add a close button. Again it's time kicking my assðŸ˜Ÿ
   - The seachbar's auto complete feature - this is still in the works and will be ready if delivery time is extended
